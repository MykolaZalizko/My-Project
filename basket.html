			<p>I tried basketball 2 years ago, when I was 16. It is already late to become a professional player, but I decided that no one can stop me from playing basketball. A heard a lot of hate to my side from people that I am not tall enough, that I am already almost an adult. But basketball is my passion and it lives in my heart, so nothing and no one could stop me.
First couple of months I was just playing and trying to get some skills. After I became better in it and I started playing with other people. It was hard for me as I was bad, but if you want to become great in something, you need to face a stronger opponent. So I was improving my skills and still doing it. When the war began, I was playing in the voluntary basketball tournaments with my friends. Money from these tournaments were gone to help Ukrainian soldiers. Once we won tournament and got 2nd place. My friends are not tall as well, so we’re the smallest on this tournament. We were on the edge every game, but we were strong, we compete and lost only final game. So, then I understood that the size doesn’t always matter.</p>
